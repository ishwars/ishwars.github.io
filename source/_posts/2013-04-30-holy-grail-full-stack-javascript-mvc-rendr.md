Spike at Airbnb just mentioned during a live TechTalk webcast that the Rendr framework they built was open sourced earlier this month: <https://github.com/airbnb/rendr>. The framework leverages Node.js and Backbone.js to allow full-stack JavaScript MVC using a common set of code–greatly improving time to content, improving crawability, and reduces overall application complexity.

During the talk, Meteor and Derby were mentioned, and Mojito \*sigh\*. And Stitch was also mentioned, as a part of the stack they're using. So anyway, there you have it. The Holy Grail [I talked about][1]. It's out, but admittedly, according to Spike, not quite finished. Caveat emptor.

Later in the talk Spike mentions they were heavily inspired by Chaplin, which you can set up quickly by reading my recent post on [developing modern web applications][2].
