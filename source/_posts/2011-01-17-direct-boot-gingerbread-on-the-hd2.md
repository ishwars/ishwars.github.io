Since the [release of a direct-boot utility for the HD2][1] there has been a flurry of activity on the XDA forums to get Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) working on the HTC HD2 smartphone. I recently switched from [dual-booting Android and WinMo][2] to a Gingerbread direct boot method and am pleased with the improvement in boot speed and battery life. But as with the dual-boot method, there are still a few hiccups here and there. Read on to learn how to replace WinMo with a Nandroid version of Android Gingerbread on the HTC HD2.

<strong id="install-hard-spl">Install Hard SPL</strong> (HSPL). HSPL3 is a custom bootloader [available for download][3] on XDA. HSPL is required to update the radio and flash custom ROMs to the phone. It is safe to install and can be uninstalled by rerunning the program setup file.

Next <strong id="upgrade-to-a-new-radio">update to a new radio</strong>. [Radios and installation instructions][4] can be found on the forums at XDA. Be sure to use a compatible version. See my [current set-up][5] for what I’m using.

After the radio is updated <strong id="install-magldr">install MAGLDR bootloader</strong>. MAGLDR serves as a second bootloader, which runs after HSPL, and can be used to Flash Nandroid ROMs to the HD2 or even play a game of Tetris. [Download MAGLDR][6] from the forums at XDA or start Googling.

To <strong id="install-gingerbread">install Gingerbread on the HD2</strong> first download any of the recent Gingerbread Nandroid ROMs from the [HD2 Android NAND Development forum][7] to a PC and extract it. Then perform a soft reset while holding down the power off button until the MAGLDR boot menu appears. Select the `USB Flasher` option and connect the HD2 to a PC using a USB cable. Once the USB connection is established run the Android installer EXE file that came with the NAND ROM to complete the installation. Alternatively, you can install a ROM straight from a zip file using <abbr title="ClockworkMod">CWM</abbr> Recovery.

Since upgrading to Gingerbread and Nandroid the biggest advantages I've noticed over [dual-booting form the SD card][2] have been:

- Faster boot time;
- Improved battery life; and
- Easier setup and maintenance.

If things seem buggy, try out a different [NAND ROM from the XDA forums][8]. Different builds will have different features working so plan to spend some time trying out different ROMs to find the best one. To get set-up more quickly on a new Android installation check out my advice on [Managing Passwords on Android][9]. Not sure which to install? Try copying my [current set-up][5] to get started.
