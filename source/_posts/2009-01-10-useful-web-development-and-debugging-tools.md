Following is a  list of cross-browser/platform web development and debugging tools useful for client-side developers. Depending on the application, one or all of these tools can be valuable in completing work on a website front-end.

> Check out the [Web UI Engineering Resources][1] page for an actively maintained list of web development resources.

## Tools for Firefox and Chrome

Build for standards.

*   [Chrome][2] includes a powerful set of development tools out of the box, including remote debugging.
*   [Firebug][3] integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of development tools at your fingertips while you browse.
*   [HTML Validator][4] is a Mozilla extension that adds HTML validation inside Firefox and Mozilla.
*   [Web Developer][5] adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools.
*   [IE Tab][6], an extension from Taiwan, embeds Internet Explorer in a Mozilla/Firefox tab. Handy but doesn&#8217;t work on a Mac.
*   [ColorZilla][7] provides Advanced Eyedropper, Color Picker, Palette Viewer and other colorful goodies for your Firefox.
*   [YSlow][8] analyzes web pages and tells you why they&#8217;re slow.
*   [HttpFox][9] monitors and analyzes all incoming and outgoing HTTP traffic between the browser and the web servers.
*   [MultiFirefox ][10]is a small launcher utility that allows you to run multiple versions of Firefox side-by-side (Mac only).
*   [User Agent Switcher][11] to spoof user agent strings for browser support testing.
*   [Fangs][12] renders a text version of a web page similar to how a screen reader would read it.
*   [Google Toolbar][13] to visualize Page Rank.

## Tools for Internet Explorer

Ensure application compatibility.

*   [Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar][14] provides a variety of tools for quickly creating, understanding, and troubleshooting Web pages. It also allows for the inspection of the MSIE-specific CSS passed in through the use of [Conditional Comments][15].
*   A look-alike is just that, not the real thing. Here are the [Internet Explorer Application Compatibility VPC Images,][16] made available by Microsoft for use in testing browser compatibility with MSIE.
*   [HttpWatch][17] is a tool for monitoring HTTP traffic in IE.

## Performance & Testing

Polish it to a bright shine.

*   [JSLint][18] helps in checking how bad your script sucks. Just copy/paste and pray.
*   [WebPagetest][19] will help access how slow your site is once it&#8217;s built.
*   [Validator.nu (X)HTML5 Validator][23] validates HTML5.
*   [HTML5 outliner][20] provides an easy to use document outline.
*   [Selenium IDE][21] for automated testing, helping unlock the potential for test-driven development in the UI layer.
*   [Paros][22] is a simplistic proxy tool that allows you to trap raw HTTP request and response headers for analysis and testing.
