So I'm putting together this killer new JS front-end development stack called [Brunch with Panache][1], which uses [Jake][2] tasks to kick off a custom set of commands for building and managing the app, and I hit a bug while code was running in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). So what now?

The problem is the stack I'm working with is complex enough a small backtrace would be about as effective as a probe into [Tesla's recent automobile fires](http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131119/AUTO01/311190039/U-S-opens-Tesla-battery-fire-investigation). Nevertheless, I want running Testlas *[sic]* so it's time to jump into some Node.js step debugging. Follow along if you'd like to learn how to get started debugging Node.js applications.

## Getting setup

Mac and Linux users, carry on.

Windows users looking to give this a try should be able to adapt these instructions after running through the steps to [Configuring the development environment](/developing-modern-web-applications-on-windows-vagrant/) to get your box ready for debugging inside a VM using Vagrant. (Tip: You do not need to follow the entire article, but you will need to download the required applications listed.)

## Find something to debug

Clone Brunch with Panache, but make sure you get v`0.7.1` to be able to recreate the error

    $ git clone https://github.com/trunkclub/brunch-with-panache/tree/0.7.1 panache && cd panache

From within the Panache directory, install the application dependencies detailed in the `package.json` (NPM) and `bower.json` (Bower) files:

    npm install && bower install

**Tip:** Windows users should use the `--no-bin-links` flag for the NPM command when using Vagrant with synced folders enabled to avoid the creation of symlinks (not supported by the NTFS filesystem).

Then install [Jake][2] globally to allow use of the application's task library:

    npm install -g jake

Once installed, run `jake gen:codetest name=smoulder` followed by `jake test:code` to stub out a unit test and ignite the Karma test runner. The end result should be a crash and burn:

    INFO [karma]: Karma v0.10.4 server started at http://localhost:9876/
    INFO [launcher]: Starting browser PhantomJS
    INFO [PhantomJS 1.9.2 (Mac OS X)]: Connected on socket 2gRJXM0iyq5MQyNS0KM1
    PhantomJS 1.9.2 (Mac OS X): Executed 0 of 0 ERROR (0.086 secs / 0 secs)
    jake aborted.
    Error
        at api.fail (/usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/jake/lib/api.js:340:13)
        at null._onTimeout (/usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/jake/lib/task/task.js:213:19)
        at Timer.listOnTimeout [as ontimeout] (timers.js:110:15)

Womp womp. What happened? Unless you're a psychic, you're not gonna be able to tell from that stack trace. So let's do some debugging.

## Install and start the Node Inspector

Thankfully due to a well placed question at a [Chicago Node.js meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Nodejs/) meetup earlier this year I didn't have to spend any time figuring out how to get started with debugging Node. The Node.js gurus at Groupon suggested [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) for step debugging.

Install the node-inspector globally from NPM:

    npm install -g node-inspector

Then start the node-inspector and background the process (use `fg` to bring it back to the foreground and `kill %1` to stop it):

    node-inspector &

## Start and connect to the debugger

Once the inspector is installed, give it something useful to debug. From the application root directory, issue the following command to use the Jake <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> to run and debug the failing task in Node:

    node --debug-brk node_modules/jake/bin/cli.js test:code

Then connect to the inspector from your local loopback by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?port=5858 in your browser. If all goes well, you'll see some developer tools (pictured below) from which to begin debugging.

**Tip:** Checkout the [sources panel keyboard shortcuts](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/shortcuts#sources-panel) for a list if things you can do without touching your mouse or trackpad.

## Tracking down the error

The bug is being caused by `test:code`, so the place to start looking is `test.jake`, which isn't available immediately after the debugger starts. To get access to `test.jake` from the debugger and get us closer to the error set a conditional breakpoint on the first line of the `run` method in `task.js` with the following criteria:

    this.fullName === 'build:dev'

Once set, resume script execution to arrive at the conditional breakpoint. From here, set another breakpoint on the line which says `spawn` within the `execute` method of `jakelib/lib/index.js` and resume execution. Once arriving at the next breakpoint press `[Esc]` to pull up the console and type `command`. The result should be `"node_modules/.bin/karma"`. If it doesn't, resume execution and wait for the next call to `execute` and check again. Turns out that `node_modules/.bin/karma couldn't be opened, resulting in the error.

## Fixing the error

Now that we know which file can't be opened (`node_modules/.bin/karma`) let's take a look at the `.bin` directory. Exit the node inspector and run `ls -al node_modules/.bin/` from the terminal. Notice a number of symlinks are shown, but _karma_ isn't one of them. To fix that simply create a symlink from `node_modules/.bin/karma` to `node_modules/karma/bin/karma`. If done properly the `jake test:code` task will no longer fail, instead it'll just get stuck. It's getting stuck because `test.jake` is running karma without the expected config. To fix that simply pipe in another argument when executing karma, e.g.

``` js
jake.Task['build:dev'].addListener('complete', function() {
  args.push('test/karma.conf.coffee'); # add argument pointing to your config here
  args.push('--single-run');
  resolve(karma.execute(args));
}).execute();
```

The next run of `jake test:code` will not only not bomb, it'll run with the expected karma config and execute tests as expected. And there you have it, a little node debugging to solve a complex problem. The [npm-folders](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/npm-folders.html) doc suggests the contents of `node_modules/.bin` are created based off the `bin` property set in `package.json`, which was not set in the `node_modules/karma/package.json` file it turns out. I've submitted [karma/issues/1131](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/1131) to this end.
